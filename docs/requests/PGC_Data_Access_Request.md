# Data Access Request / Letter of Intent
**To:** PGC Data Access Committee (DAC)  
**From:** [Your Name/Title]  
**Date:** October 26, 2023  
**Subject:** Application for Access to PGC MDD Summary Statistics for MO-AFN Project  

---

**Dear Members of the PGC Data Access Committee,**

I am writing to formally request access to the Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Summary Statistics and individual-level genotype data (if applicable to specific sub-studies) for my academic research project titled **"MO-AFN: Multi-Omics Attention Fusion Network for Precision Psychiatry."**

### Research Objective
The primary goal of this study is to develop a novel computational framework that predicts antidepressant treatment responses by fusing genomic data with transcriptomic profiles. By integrating these distinct modalities, we aim to uncover non-linear interactions between genetic variants and gene expression levels that traditional unimodal analyses often miss.

### Methodology
We propose to utilize a **Cross-Modal Attention Mechanism** to learn a joint latent space representation of the data. Specifically, we aim to:
1.  Use PGC MDD data to identify high-risk variants and polygenic risk scores.
2.  Fuse this genomic information with transcriptomic data (from public repositories like interacting GEO datasets) using our Multi-Omics Attention Fusion Network (MO-AFN).
3.  Train deep learning models to classify responders vs. non-responders to standard antidepressant treatments.

### Data Security and Compliance
I understand the sensitive nature of genomic data. We are committed to strict adherence to the PGC's data handling protocols:
*   **Non-Identification:** We will not attempt to identify individuals.
*   **Security:** Data will be stored on a secure, comprehensive server with restricted access limited to authorized personnel within our research group.
*   **Data Use:** The data will be used solely for the non-commercial academic research described above.
*   **Dissemination:** No individual-level data will be shared. All publications will report only aggregate results.

We believe this multi-omics approach holds significant promise for advancing precision psychiatry and better understanding the biological underpinnings of treatment resistance in depression.

We look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

**[Your Name]**
